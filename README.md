##CSS-only full-page image slider

You can find the original idea for this project here: [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/create-a-fullscreen-slider-with-css).

Besides small modifications, I've made the following additions:
1. a project.json file..
2. Grunt..
3. the Grunt plugin "grunt-contrib-imagemin"..
4. a new directory into which the compressed images will be generated..
