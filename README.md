## CSS-only full-page image slider

You can find the original idea for this project here: [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/create-a-fullscreen-slider-with-css).

Besides small modifications, I've made the following additions:

1. a package.json file
2. Grunt
3. the Grunt plugin "grunt-contrib-imagemin"
4. a new directory into which the compressed images will be generated
